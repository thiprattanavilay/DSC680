# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a part of the Masters of Data Science degree at [Bellevue Uninversity](https://www.bellevue.edu/degrees/master/data-science-ms/). You can also find my latest work on [my main GitHub repo](https://github.com/thiprattanavilay?tab=repositories).

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this portfolio is a collection of all the data science projects throughout my M.S. program in Data Science at Bellevue University. In this Data Science program, I have conduct several data science projects from origin to presentation. I have gather data, then prepare, clean, analyze, and present the analysis to an audience in a recorded video/presentation.
